Image Search Abstraction Layer
=========================

**User Stories:**

1. I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.

2. I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.

3. I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.


**Example image search:**

https://plain-banjo.glitch.me/api/imagesearch/buster?offset=2

**Would you like to see the last ten searches?**
